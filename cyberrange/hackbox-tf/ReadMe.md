This is a terraform code set for deploying a Cyber Range (hackerbox) in AWS.

Make sure you have necessary AWS credentials setup (using AWS Access Keys in local PC)
Next run the following terraform commands inside TF code folder

```bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
```

Once you have finished deploying you can access the EC2 instance either by logging in the AWS Web GUI console and access through AWS Session Manager or simply using the SSH key generated by the Terraform



Important log files are exported and streamed into CloudWatch log groups, you can add or change the log files which needs to be stream by editing ec2_init/aws_logs.json file

You can access the log streams from the CloudWatch Console

There's a sample website setup through nginx.
